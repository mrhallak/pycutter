# Pycutter

Pycutter is designed to streamline the setup process for Python projects. By leveraging the power of [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter), it provides a standardized project structure and pre-configured settings, allowing developers to focus on coding rather than project setup.
